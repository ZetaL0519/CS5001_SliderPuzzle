The game is consisted of four main parts:
1. The display screen and user input

4. leaderboard, including reading, displaying and updating

For the first part, there are DrawRectangle.py and Board.py
For the second part, there are Slide.py, SlideGame.py, ValidationService.py
For the third part, there are ButtonService.py

*** Future Improvement
1. If the user clicks on the board before the last move finishes, it will stuck. So the future improvement should be
that if the user click on the board too quick, it will not affect the process.

2. The err file is not perfect. Need improvement in the future.

3. Sometimes when the user hits load button , the empty slide square is not removed. Haven't figured out why.
